The production of blood is driven by a small group of haematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow. With age they acquire mutations which, if conveying some selective advantage, can expand within the population and reach high prevalence in the blood. This phenomenon, dubbed clonal haematopoiesis, is pervasive amongst the elderly and, while typically benign, conveys an increased risk of cancer and other haematological malignancies.
Current evidence suggests it may be the natural outcome of a surprisingly simple model of evolutionary dynamics: one where mutants are born randomly over time and expand according to a genetically determined fitness. Indeed, recent studies have shown that distinct clones may exist simultaneously, and that many clones of known cancer genes present stable sigmoidal growth when tracked longitudinally. However, two observations remain unexplained. First, identical mutations do not confer the same fitness across individuals; and second, clonal fitness appears to decrease later in life. 
Here we propose these phenomena in fact arise naturally from a more sophisticated model of population genetics: If most expanded mutants remain – despite their selective advantage – susceptible to the blood’s normal control mechanisms, we arrive at a picture of competing mutants whose effective fitness decreases as the competition grows, a phenomenon known as clonal interference. Through mathematical modelling and computational simulations we show how a recent public dataset of 800 longitudinally tracked variants displays signatures of such clonal competition. The existence of such competition and its effect on clone fitness has important implications for how we think about carinogenesis and what it means for tissues to be "pre-cancerous".
